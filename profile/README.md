## About:

This project is training on microservices architecture and I'm planning to use different tech stacks and separate the logic into different APIs (May be not the best solution in real life, But as I said, It's just a training on how to connect all the pieces together!)

## Goal:
 - Prepare a project with every single thing I know (Just expressing my skills!).
 - Learn how **Microservices Architecture** works.
 - Learn more about testing, such as: unit testing ,etc...
 - Learn more how to show my work by good documentation!!

## The pieces in my mind for the moment: 
- Identity Provider API **(Working on now!)**
- Gateway API
- Logging API
- Payment API
- Chatting API
- Notification API
- Admin API
- Freelancer API
- Client API
