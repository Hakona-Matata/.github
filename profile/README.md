## About:

This project is training on microservices architecture and I'm planning to separate the logic into different APIs (May be not the best solution in real life, But as I said, It's just a training on how to connect all the pieces together!)

## Goal:
 - Prepare a project with every single thing I know (Just expressing my skills!).
 - Learn how **Microservices Architecture** works.
 - Learn more about testing, such as: unit testing, integration testing, e2e testing, etc...
 - Learn more how to show my work by good documentation!!

## The pieces in my mind for the moment: 
- Identity Provider API **(Working on now!)**
- Gateway API
- Logging API
- Payment API
- Chatting API
- Notification API
- Admin API
- Freelancer API
- Client API
- Mailing API
- Caching API
